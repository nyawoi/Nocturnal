# Welcome to Nocturnal

## What is Nocturnal?

Nocturnal is a server-side multiplayer mod to facilitate the sleeping process when playing with friends.

Ever pulled an all-nighter, simply because you couldn't coordinate with your pack of unorganized friends?
Yeah, we've all been there.
What better way to get everyone on-board, then, than with a shiny notification?
You'll have your friends zooming for their beds in no time!

## What does the mod add to Staxel?

As of right now, the mod is basic, and simply adds a sleeping player counter, notifying all players on the server of the amount of players in bed.
It will be disabled during the day, and will only show up whenever it's possible to advance the night by sleeping.

## What is planned for the future?

If possible, the mod aims to add a customizable percentage of sleeping players required to advance the night.
Want half of the players to be able to advance the night? Do go ahead.
Want only a single player to be able to advance the night? Be my guest!
Again, this is purely theoretical, at the moment.
If it proves to be too difficult or impossible to implement, Nocturnal will have to find other features to add.

## What does it mean to be a server-side mod?
Only the server host must have the mod installed for all players on the server to be able to benefit from it.
Every player will be able to view the sleeping player counter, regardless if they have the mod installed or not.
If you can't coordinate sleep schedules, imagine coordinating mods!

If you have any ideas for the mod, feel free to share them.
Likewise, if you have a bug report to file, please do!
